[(click here to run this webpage on gihub pages.)](https://ayusouttahere.github.io/clone.amazon/)

Made this one just to feel confident about my frontEnd Skills :3 

well, i have only used HTML nd CSS in this one **on nvim tho.**
I learned source control to push this on gitHub too..
as soon as hand holding honeymoon ended, i was wondering if i could really make something out of what i have learned so i tried this(yesh i took a refrence but shhhh )

<h3>to be edited...</h3>
I might add some changes or expand this project later but... ;)
